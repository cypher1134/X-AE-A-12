## Project context and description

<p style='text-align : justify'> 
    Nowadays, fake news are widely spread on social media et especially on Twitter (X). Furthermore, it is for big companies, politicians and other renowed people important to control their digital and public reputation. Therefore, our product appears as a tool for such clients to keep track and battle misinformation and could be used by unique users but also by private companies. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Our project aims to detect fake news and to rank them. Depending on its impact on other users, on how viral it is and other criterion, our program allows the consumer to follow the evolution of a fake news through time. 
</p>

## Needs analysis

**Tweet analysis:** 

<ul style='text-align : justify'> 
    <li> A unique user will be able to access some (limited) information about a chosen subject (free account). </li>
    <li>Companies or more widely known organizations should be able to follow the digital opinion about them (premium account).</li>
    <li> As seen higher, we could monetize our services through a subscription service to access better options (such as Twitter Blue). Free accounts will be able to have access to a limited number of requests using tweets published only recently (a week-widthspan) Premium accounts will be able to have access to unlimited requests over tweets over a longer period. </li>
</ul>
